            <h5>Unity Game Engine Project</h5>
            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>The purpose of this project was to create a card game</p>
            <h3>Gameplay Flow</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Standard deck of 52 playing cards.</li>
                <li>Draw 2 cards.</li>
                <li>Use numerical value of the card to determine
                    which card is "higher" or "lower".
                </li>
                <li>If the numerical values are equal then use suit value
                    to determine the "higher" card.
                    Suit hierarchy is Spades > Hearts > Diamonds > Clubs.
                </li>
                <li>Continue to draw two cards from the deck until it is depleted.
                    When no cards remain, return all cards to the deck and shuffle.
                </li>                
            </ol>
            <h3>Requirements</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hearts and Ace of Spades have increased chance 
                        of being drawn. Each Heart Suit card should have
                        2X the chance of being drawn than the normal cards.
                        The Ace of Spades should have 3X the chance of being drawn
                        than the normal cards.
                    </li>
                    <li>The same card cannot appear twice in one draw (for example,
                        there cannot be two Ace of Spades on the table at once).
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>My game was created using Unity Game Engine. 
                I created a script responsible for placing and moving the cards on the screen.
                I also created a second script responsible for the random selection of a card from
                the deck.
            </p>

            <h4>Statistics Theory</h4>

            <p>One important observation that was a instructive moment for
                myself was how to handle increasing the chances of a card 
                being drawn. My first intuition was to just double or triple 
                the weight of the card, however it turned out to be incorrect.
                It must be understood that when you double a card in the deck,
                the total deck size will also increase. If the increase deck size
                is not accounted for, then the sum of all probabilities will be 
                greater than 1. According to theory, the sum of all probabilities
                must be equal to 1. In order to address this issue, I created a
                second virtual deck that is seperate from the playing deck of
                52 cards. This virtual deck size ended up being larger than 52.
                I also had to create another boolean C# list to track which cards 
                were still in the playing deck. I then used the C# random function
                to generate a random integer for the index of the virtual deck.
                The card is then drawn from the playing deck and the virtual deck
                is rebuilt.
            </p>
            <h4>Results</h4>
            <p>This approach meant that my script will need
                to iterate through the deck after every draw and rebuild
                the virtual deck used for handling the probabilities.
                I think that this will need improvement if more decks of
                cards are involved and more complicated chance multipliers
                are added.
            </p>
